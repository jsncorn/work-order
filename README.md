# Automotive Work Order Database

In the automotive industry, work orders must be created in order for both the employee
and customer to know what labor is being performed on the vehicle. However, a common practice
in the industry is to print out the work form. This is very inefficient as it wastes paper and
only one employee can have the sheet at a given time (unless you waste more paper). With this website,
service advisors and technicians are able to communicate effectively about what work needs to be
done - all without paper.
